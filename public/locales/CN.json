Buying on Monday and closing the position on Tuesday, the buying interest rate is -0.4%, then the overnight interest of the position he held for 1 night = 112.16 * 100000 * 1 * -0.4% * 1/360 = -124.62 yen = -1.11 USD.": "例如：陈先生开仓买入1手美元兑日元，收市价是112.16。周一买入周二平仓，买利率为-0.4%，那么他持仓过1晚的过夜利息=112.16*100000*1*-0.4%*1/360=-124.62日元=-1.11美元。",
