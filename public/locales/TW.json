  "How is my profit and loss calculated?": "我的盈虧如何計算？",
  "Floating profit and loss = (selling price-buying price) * contract units * lots.": "浮動盈虧=(賣出價-買入價)*合約單位*手數。",

  "Then, the total profit and loss = (selling price-buying price) * contract unit * transaction number ± overnight interest = (1.1780-1.1710) * 100000 * 0.5 ± 0 = 350 US dollars.": "那麼，總盈虧=（賣出價-買入價）*合約單位*交易手數±過夜利息=（1.1780-1.1710）*100000*0.5±0=350美元。",

  "Forex overnight interest = Prev. price* contract unit * lot * interest rate * days / 360": "不同產品的過夜利息計算公式不一樣。外匯過夜利息=昨收價格*合約單位*手數*利率*天數/360",
  "For example: Mr. Chen opened a position to buy 1 lot of USD / JPY, and the closing price was 112.16. Buying on Monday and closing the position on Tuesday, the buying interest rate is -0.4%, then the overnight interest of the position he held for 1 night = 112.16 * 100000 * 1 * -0.4% * 1/360 = -124.62 yen = -1.11 USD.": "例如：陳先生開倉買入1手美元兌日元，收市價是112.16。週一買入週二平倉，買利率為-0.4%，那麼他持倉過1晚的過夜利息=112.16*100000*1*-0.4%*1/360=-124.62日元=-1.11美元。",

  "What are \"Take Profit Orders\" and \"Stop Loss Orders\"?": "什麼是“止盈單”及“止損單”？",

Investors will have the opportunity to make greater profits than normal.": "止盈單： 止盈單可以幫助投資者鎖定利潤。投資者預設一個獲取利潤的訂單後，如市場價格達到投資者設定的觸發價格時，止盈單將會成為市價單，並以當時可執行的最優市場價格成交。投資者將有機會獲取比正常情況更大的利潤。",

In this case, the order will be executed at the next most favorable price in the market. In addition, investors can modify or cancel various orders at any time during the trading time before the order is executed, but still need to meet the company's requirements for setting orders.": "注：請留意，任何訂單（包括止盈、止損等）均可能因市況波動，受跳空的影響，未能在預設的價格執行。如遇上此情況，訂單將會按照市場下一個最有利的價格執行。此外，投資者可以在訂單被執行之前的交易時間內，隨時修改或取消各種訂單，但仍需符合本公司對設定訂單的要求。",

  "There are four types of pending orders:": "掛單交易有四種類型：",
  "1.Buy stop: Refers to a buy operation instruction for a pending order at a price higher than the current price relative to the current price;": "1、Buy stop：停損買進 指在相對與目前現價而言高於現價的價格掛單的買進操作指令；",
  "2. Buy limit: Refers to an operating order for a pending order at a price lower than the current price;": "2、Buy limit：限價買進 指相對現價而言，低於現價的價格掛單的買進的操作指令；",
  "3, Sell stop: Refers to a sell operation instruction for a pending order at a price lower than the current price;": "3、Sell stop：停損賣出 指相對現價而言，低於現價的價格掛單的賣出操作指令；",
  "4. Sell limit: Relative to the current price, a sell operation instruction for a pending order above the current price.": "4、Sell limit：限價賣出 指相對現價而言，高於現價的價格掛單的賣出操作指令。",

  "What is lock-position?": "什麼是鎖倉？",
  "The lock-position(also called hedging) generally refers to a type of trading in which the same product is traded in the same quantity but in the opposite direction, so that no matter where the price moves (or rises or falls), the profit or loss will not increase or decrease significantly.": "所謂鎖倉，一般是指交易者對同一個產品做數量相等但方向相反的開倉交易，以便不管價格向何方運動（或漲或跌）均不會使持倉盈虧再出現大幅增減的一種操作方法。",
  "What is hedging margin?": "什麼是鎖倉保證金？",
  "When a client locks a position, the margin for the lockup is 1/4 of the sum of the hedging orders.": "當客戶進行鎖倉的時候，鎖倉的保證金是鎖倉訂單保證金總和的1/4。",
  "For example, buying 1 lot of USD and Yen and selling 1 lot of USD and Yen is a hedging operation. At this time, the margin is (200 + 200) * 0.25 = 100USD.": "例如買入1手美元日元，賣出1手美元日元，就是鎖倉操作，此時的保證金為（200+200）*0.25=100USD。",

  "At this time, the lock-position margin is (400 + 400) * 25% = 200 USD.": "此時鎖倉保證金為(400+400)*25%=200美元。",
  "If one of the positions is closed, you need to make up the guaranteed amount of open positions (1 lot of GBPUSD), that is, increase the margin to $ 400 before the system can unlock.": "如其中一持倉單平倉，您需要補足未平倉單的保證金額度（1手英鎊美元），即增加保證金至400美元，系統才能進行解鎖。",

For details, please refer to the product margin and liquidation rules.": "我司強制平倉點為當淨值低於保證金的20%則進行強平，週末和節假日過市為200%。詳情請查詢產品保證金及強平細則。",
  "For example, if a customer has 1,000 USD in his account, bought 1 lot of USD and JPY, and took up 200 USD as occupied margin , now the available margin on the account is 800 USD. When you buy in the wrong direction, you will lose money from the available margin of $ 800. After the loss of $ 800, the initial loss of $ 200 will be reduced to only 20%, which is $ 40 or less，then the position will be automatically closed.": "例如﹕客戶帳戶裏有1,000美元，買入了1手美元日元，佔用了200美元，那麼帳戶可用的保證金為800美元。當買錯了方向，會從800美元的可用保證金先進行虧損，虧損完800美元以後，在200美元初始保證金裏，再虧損到只剩下20%，也就是40美元或者以下的時候，會被強行平倉。",
